This is a collection of tools that I have written for use in minecraft. The current list is as follows:

1. sc.py - a tool to search for open minecraft servers using the shodan api
2. afk fishing tool
3. tool to periodically send commands

There is currently no documentation for the tools but they are pretty small.
